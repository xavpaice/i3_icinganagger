# This script is a simple wrapper which prefixes each i3status line with custom
# information. It is a python reimplementation of:
# http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3status/tree/contrib/wrapper.pl
#
# To use it, ensure your ~/.i3status.conf contains this line:
#     output_format = "i3bar"
# in the 'general' section.
# Then, in your ~/.i3/config, use:
#     status_command i3status | ~/i3status/contrib/wrapper.py
# In the 'bar' section.
#
# In its current version it will display the cpu frequency governor, but you
# are free to change it to display whatever you like, see the comment in the
# source code below.
